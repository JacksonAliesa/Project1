1. What the project does
    TravelME functions by: 
    A. Taking user selection for climate preference (three choices). 
    B. Taking user selection for nightlife preference (three choices). 
    C. Inputting the selections to match a hard-coded array of cities. 
    D. After selecting the city from the array, the "city" text becomes a string, which is used in an API GET method. That method is used to find: 
        i. Events in the area (using YELP API)
        ii. Restaurants in the area (using YELP API)
        iii. A Street Image from the city (using Streetview Static Images Google API)
    E. All of the above is run through a submit button. 
    F. Separately, there is a "NearMe" button that is autoset to have the city equal Philadelphia, so the exact same steps are made using Philadelphia as the string. 
    G. Finally, when the city name populates, the name is an href, linking to a wikipedia page of the selected city. 

Why the project is useful
    The idea of the project is removing decision paralysis from a traveler's thought process. A user can simply input a couple of simple variables, and the project spits out a city that the user may not have expected. The goal is to make it easier for the user to find a city they would actually enjoy based on their preferences.
